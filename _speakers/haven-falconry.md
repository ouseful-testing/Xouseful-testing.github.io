Not part of the Somewehen Storytelling Festival, but that doesn't mean you can't avail yourself of all the other attraction the Isle of Steam Railway at Havenstreet has to offer...

A partner attraction to the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, Haven Falconry is tucked away in a corner of the Havenstreet station, next to the Events barn.

Marvel at the vast collection of owls, hawks, falcons, eagles and vultures where their care and welfare is the teams utmost priority.
