Michael & Wendy Dacre, aka Raven Tales, have been telling tales together since 1988 in words, song, shadow puppets and giant processional puppets at festivals, arts centres, village halls, schools and outdoors for English Heritage and the National Trust - also touring in Europe, India and Australia. Our material is mainly traditional: fairytales, folktales, myths and legends, with forays into Icelandic Saga and the (very) odd literary tale.

They have been commissioned to make shadow shows for Beyond the Border and The York Puppet Conference.

Michael is a published author, and Wendy runs a storytellersâ€™ network, and now makes Crankies (Rolly Stories!) in a variety of media, including shadow.
