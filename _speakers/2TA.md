Isle of Wight trio Second Time Around (Tina, James and John) perform a huge variety of music including both traditional and contemporary folk, blues, americana, early jazz and roots music from around the world.

The band's multi instrumental talents enables them to produce a rich and varied sound scape whether playing an Irish jig, a Finnish waltz, an old English folk ballad or a touch of swamp blues. Throw some self penned songs into the mix and it's easy to see why they have gained a reputation for keeping their audience guessing about what they might hear next.

Check out their latest album, *House of Cards*, released early in 2023 on Bandcamp now: [House of Cards [album]](https://2ndta.bandcamp.com/album/house-of-cards?pk=595)
