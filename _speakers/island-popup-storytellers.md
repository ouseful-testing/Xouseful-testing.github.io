*The Island Storytellers formed in 2007 and are a group of adults from diverse backgrounds keen to keep alive and promote oral storytelling. They meet on a monthly basis, somewhere on the island, with occasional extra events such as arranging visiting storytellers and running storytelling workshops.*
