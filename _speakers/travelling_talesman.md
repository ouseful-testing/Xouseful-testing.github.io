Performer of myths, legends, folktales and the occasional poem. An energetic and engaging performer. With over twenty years professional experience, Cliff Eastabrook, aka *The Travelling Talesman*, has gigged widely for a wide variety of adult and family audiences, touring the country from Penzance to York, for feasts, festivals and fun since the early nineties.

With a repertoire that includes tales of Norse Gods, Celtic mysteries, clever girls and dragon Slayers, medieval mayhem, giants, goblins and halloween horrors, who wouldn't want the Travelling Talesman to come calling?!
