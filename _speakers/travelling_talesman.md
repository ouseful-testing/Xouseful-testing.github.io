Appearing on tours and at festivals for over 30 years, Cliff brings an energetic, witty and engaging style steeped in folk tales and myths from around the world, but not always how you remember them.

*All the way from the West Country, meet our teller of myths, legends, folktales and the occasional poem, presented in a energetic and engaging performance.*

*With a repertoire that includes tales of Norse Gods, Celtic mysteries, clever girls and dragon Slayers, medieval mayhem, giants, goblins and halloween horrors, who wouldn't want the Travelling Talesman to come calling?!*
