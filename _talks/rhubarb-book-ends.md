With a rickety old book cart and some novel ideas, surprises leap off every page wherever our papery pals roam.  Join our book-bonkers buddies as they act out tales of whales, bonkers bears and manic monsters. Be amazed as they twist fantastic adventures of pathetic pirates, merry musketeers and hairy hairdressers.

Full of music, comedy and general silliness, Rhubarb Theatre returns with this fun and fantastical festival show that becomes – quite literally – out of this world!
