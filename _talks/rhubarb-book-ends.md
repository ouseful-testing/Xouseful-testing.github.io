With a rickety old book cart and some novel ideas, surprises leap off every page wherever our papery pals roam.  Join our book-bonkers buddies as they act out tales of whales, bonkers bears and manic monsters. Be amazed as they twist fantastic adventures of pathetic pirates, merry musketeers and hairy hairdressers.

*A costumed set from Rhubarb Theatre that is guaranteed to entertain all the family.*
