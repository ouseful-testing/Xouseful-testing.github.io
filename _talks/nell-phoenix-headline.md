__Headline set from Nell Phoenix, 16+__

The Girl Who Married a Dog

Over a vast swath of northern Earth,  in a cold and a snow-blinding landscape, the weirdest, wildest stories are told … fierce, rude, funny and seriously strange.

Nell Phoenix revels in the earthy humour and passions of these primal stories; peopled with unconventional families, the desperate and lonely-hearted, and elderly relatives with their misguided attempts to assist.

Ages: 16 +
