*Over the course of two sets, one in the Event Barn, and one on the Woodland stage,  Greg Chapman will beguile and bewilder with a range of tales from the History of Magic.*

The history of magic is full of characters, exciting events, rivalries, and, of course, lots of magic!

For his morning set, magician Greg Chapman shares some of the stories behind some of his favourite tricks, and some of the past performers who shared them with the world.

And a yet more intriguing question will be answered in his afternoon set: what is the oldest known magic trick in the world, and what does it have to do with King Charles III? Greg tells this tale and more stories from the history of magic!
