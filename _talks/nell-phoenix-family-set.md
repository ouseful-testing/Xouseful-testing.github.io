AARGH GIANTS! NIX NOUGHT NOTHING

*Family friendly show, ages: 4+*

In an almighty mix-up, a prince is given to a giant as his servant, but when the prince and the giantâ€™s daughter decide to flee, everything unravels into wild tale of wonder. Nell Phoenix tells a romping story of magic and mayhem, impossible tasks, wild chases, and a galumphing giant partial to prince-panini!
