A beautiful little festival show about 3 quirky characters that meet by chance at a train station…

Where is the train? Will it arrive?  As time tick-tocks onwards our 3 accidental companions become more and more playful, passing the time in amusing and joyful ways – who knows what might happen next?

Full of mime, physical theatre, music and fun, this is a silly and sweet Rhubarb street-treat for all the family!
