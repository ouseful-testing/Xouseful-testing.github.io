What happens when the chosen one is really a fool? A magic fox, a giant with five heads, The Seven big Women of Denmark, and a princess with her own plans get caught up in this utter numpties attempt to retrieve some golden apples.

*Myths, legends, and folktales... The Travelling Talesman makes it over from the West Country to the Island, bringing a selection of tales for all ages to our first Somewhen Storytelling Festival.*
