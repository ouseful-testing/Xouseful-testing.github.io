An intergenerational playtime - make simple shadow puppets, use them in a made-up story and then take them home with you.

*Details of workshop.* This will be used on our website and in other publicity for your session.Wendy will show everyone how to make simple  shadow puppets of whatever character you fancy. Little ones may need some help cutting them out! Then weâ€™ll add sticks and show you how to move them on the back-lit translucent screen.

Michael will help everyone use their puppets to tell a short made up, and probably rather wild story.

__*Drop-in, for all ages, make an unique show all together!*__
