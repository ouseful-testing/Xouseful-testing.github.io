__A (story) Walk on the Wild Side__

Dare you step off the path into to wilderness to hear a tale or two?  This storywalk for all ages, is ideal if you can bring both your courage and a friend.**

Take a walk on the wild side of Havenstreet in this woodland story walk. It is suitable  for adults and children but the route may be uneven, there may be trip hazards, and possibly slippery slides to quagmires and bogs.  There may be (mini) beasts and predators. But don't worry, Sue-the-storyteller will lead you through the woods with stops to hear tales of courage and wonder and bring you back to safety.
