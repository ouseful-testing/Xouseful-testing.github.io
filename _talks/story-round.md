An open storytelling session for tellers and listeners alike.

Storycircles are the life-blood of the storytelling community, providing an opportunity to tell your first story in a supportive setting, try out a new one, or share one of your favourite tales.


*Short tales — 5 mins or so — to be told, not read. Traditional tales preferred.*
